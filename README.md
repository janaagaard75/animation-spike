# Animation Spike Test

Spike test about figuring out how to animating draggable items in React Native.

Created both a class and a functional style solution. The functional solution does not always get the color of the square right. Don't know if this is a shortcoming in my implementation or that the animation state handling in this example requires a bit more fine tuned control than what is possible with hooks. It is not because the class version is the first one.

TODO: Add the possibility to drag the boxes.
